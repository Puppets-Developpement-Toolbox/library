# Carlo

Carlo is a PHP templating engine whose content structures are described in YAML, and the WordPress plugin built
on it, developed by [Puppets](https://puppets.fr). A theme declares its page templates, regions and sections in a
`structure.yml` file; every section becomes a native block in the WordPress block editor, and is rendered by a
plain PHP template on the site.

| Path | Content |
| --- | --- |
| `src/carlo` | the engine, without WordPress: drivers, structure loading, fields, data loading, introspection |
| `src/templates` | generic sections and components (PHP template + YAML structure), see [these mockups](https://www.figma.com/design/YAGncUCOUdVUay7mKLAH2x/-LIB--Diapsodie?node-id=2-4&p=f&t=QDyYKzHqjUoKvxHK-0) |
| `wp.php`, `src/wp`, `assets` | the WordPress plugin: driver, blocks, regions, page templates, component catalogue, editor scripts |
| `library.css`, `src/css`, `src/js` | front-end styles and scripts (Tailwind 4) |
| `demo` | standalone demo of the templates, without WordPress |
| `dev` | WordPress development environment (Bedrock + Lando) and browser tests, see [dev/README.md](./dev/README.md) |

Further reading: [Carlo.md](./Carlo.md) (concepts, in French) and [README-AI.md](./README-AI.md) (code
architecture, for developers and AI agents changing the code).

## Requirements

- PHP 8.1+ and WordPress 6.5+ (block API v3, `wp_is_serving_rest_request()`).
- A theme with a `structure.yml` file at its root: without it, the plugin does nothing.
- Composer, through which the package and its dependency (`symfony/yaml`) are installed.
- `idleberg/wordpress-vite-assets` in the site's dependencies: it loads the theme's assets in production and is
  not declared by the package yet.

## Installation (Bedrock)

```json
{
  "repositories": [
    { "type": "vcs", "url": "https://github.com/Puppets-Developpement-Toolbox/library.git" }
  ],
  "require": { "puppets/carlo": "<branch or version>" }
}
```

The package type is `wordpress-plugin`: it is installed in `web/app/plugins/carlo`. Then:

1. Activate the **Carlo** plugin.
2. In the theme, call `carlo_bootstrap()` from `index.php`: the plugin picks the template and renders the page.
3. Import the library styles in the theme's CSS: `@import "../../../plugins/carlo/library.css";`.

The theme's assets are loaded with Vite (see [Assets](#assets)).

## Elements

Sections (`sections/…`) and components (`components/…`) are **elements**. An element is identified by
`type/name:variant`, e.g. `sections/push:pictos`; the variant defaults to `base` (`sections/text` =
`sections/text:base`). Each element is made of files in a `templates/` folder:

```
templates/sections/quote/
├── base.php           # the template
├── base.yml           # its structure: the fields (optional for an element without data)
├── base.stories.yml   # examples for the component catalogue (optional)
└── dark.php           # a variant: dark.yml and dark.stories.yml fall back to base.* when absent
```

A missing file of a variant falls back to the `base` file, for the template, the structure and the stories
alike. A flat file (`templates/sections/quote.php`) is also accepted for the `base` variant.

Files are looked up, first found wins, in: the child theme, the parent theme, the plugin (`src/wp/templates`),
then the library (`src/templates`). A theme overrides any element of the library by providing the same file.
Elements of another library can be registered as a namespace:
`carlo_register_namespace('restaurant', $path)`, then `@restaurant:sections/menu`.

## structure.yml

```yaml
menus:
  main: Menu principal              # registered as a WordPress menu location

regions:                            # labels shown in the editor
  header: En-tête
  content: Contenu

templates:                          # page templates; `default` is used when none is chosen
  default:
    _label: Page éditoriale
    content:                        # a region and the sections it accepts
      - _blocs: [!load sections/text, !load sections/image, !load sections/quote]
        _max: 6                     # at most 6 sections in this region
  landing:
    _label: Page templatisée
    header: [!load sections/image]
    content: [!load sections/text, !load sections/quote]

types:                              # custom post types
  project:
    wp_args:                        # arguments of register_post_type()
      label: Projets
      supports: [title, thumbnail]
    template:                       # its template (or `templates:` with several, `default` first)
      _label: Fiche projet
      content: [!load sections/text]
```

- `!load sections/text` inserts the structure of an element. It is the only YAML tag: any other tag
  (e.g. a typo such as `!components`) raises an error naming the file.
- A region proposes every section it lists, in any order and number (up to `_max`).
- The template of a content is chosen when it is created (« Pages > Ajouter : Page templatisée ») and cannot
  change afterwards. The posts page uses the `archive` template.

## Fields

A field is declared in the element's `.yml`, by its type alone or with options:

```yaml
titre: text_short
content:
  _type: wysiwyg
  _label: Contenu
  _help: Texte affiché sous le titre.
quote: !load components/quote       # a component: a group of fields with its own template
items:
  _type: repeater
  _min: 1                           # or _times for an exact number
  _max: 6
  _add_button: Ajouter une carte
  _repeat:
    title: text_short
    image: image
pages:
  _type: reference
  _ref_type: [page, project]
  _max: 3
style:
  _type: choices
  _choices: { light: Clair, dark: Sombre }
```

| Type | Editor | Value in the template |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `text_short` | typed in the block | string |
| `text` | typed in the block | string, line breaks as `<br />` |
| `wysiwyg` | typed in the block (TinyMCE dialog) | HTML, paragraphs added (`wpautop`) |
| `url`, `number` | Settings panel | string, number |
| `boolean` | Settings panel | `bool` |
| `image` | Settings panel (media library) | attachment ID, for `carlo_img()` |
| `choices` | Settings panel (`_multi` for several) | the chosen key(s) |
| `reference` | Settings panel (search, ordered list) | published `WP_Post` objects |
| `group` | its fields, in the block or the panel | array, with the component's `_id` |
| `repeater` | Settings panel, items added and ordered | list of arrays |

A text field used inside an HTML attribute (e.g. `id="<?= carlo_get('ancre') ?>"`) is typed in the
Settings panel instead of the block. `select` is a deprecated name of `choices`; `image` with `_multi` is a `gallery`. Other types (`gallery`,
`color`, `date`, `datetime`, `embed`, `file`, `link`, `taxonomy`) are stored but not editable yet: the editor
shows a notice in their place.

Every declared field reaches the template, with a default value when it is empty (`''`, `false` for a
boolean, `[]` for a group, repeater, gallery or reference): templates do not need `isset()`.

## The block editor

- Each region of the content's template is a locked block, which only accepts the sections it lists, up to
  its `_max` (a counter shows it).
- Each section is a block (`carlo/sections-text`, `carlo/sections-push-pictos`…). Its preview is the real
  template rendered by the server, with the theme's CSS; text fields are typed directly in it, the other
  fields are in the Settings panel. Change `structure.yml`, reload the editor: the blocks follow.
- A section left empty is not rendered on the site; the editor shows a message in its place.

## Templates

```php
<?= carlo_get('titre') ?>                              // a value; 'quote.author' for a nested one
<?php carlo_component('quote') ?>                      // a group field, rendered by its own template
<?php carlo_render('components/cta', carlo_get('cta')) ?>
<?= carlo_img('image', '630x394') ?>                   // responsive image (see below)
<?php carlo_menu('main') ?>                            // renders templates/menus/main.php with `items`
```

Values arrive formatted (see the table above). Data that does not come from a block, such as a query in a
custom template, is loaded with `carlo_load_data($id, $values)`: it is formatted like block data and becomes
readable with `carlo_get()`.

`carlo_bootstrap()` picks the template: `templates/<template>.php` of the theme when it exists (`archive` for
the posts page, `error` for a 404, the page template slug or `default`, `type_<post_type>` for a single post),
otherwise the regions of the content's template, in their order. The `carlo_prerender` action runs first,
with the template name.

### Images

```php
carlo_img('image', '630x394');                                          // one size
carlo_img('image', ['1200x800', '(max-width: 767px)' => '600x400']);    // default size + <source> per media
carlo_img('image', '630x394', ['class' => 'cover']);                    // attributes (with a `class` key)
```

Sizes are WordPress image sizes, registered in the theme with `carlo_register_img_size('630x394')` (cropped)
or `carlo_register_img_size('630x394:0')` (not cropped; the size is then named `630x394:0`), several at once
with an array.

### Assets

The plugin loads the theme's `js/main.js` and `css/global.css`: from the Vite server in development
(`WP_ENV=development`, `ASSET_BASE_URL`), from the theme's `dist/.vite/manifest.json` otherwise. The same CSS is
loaded in the editor's canvas, so that previews look like the site.

## Component catalogue

A catalogue of every section and component (library, plugin and theme), each rendered in isolation with the
theme's CSS and JS: `/?carlo-stories`, or Appearance > Catalogue.

- Not loaded in production (`WP_ENV`). Elsewhere (development, staging) it is public, without login, and sends
  `X-Robots-Tag: noindex`. Only discovered elements can be rendered.
- Examples are written in `<variant>.stories.yml`, next to the template. Each key is an example; values use
  the block attributes format and get the same formatting as on the site:

```yaml
complete:
  _label: Citation complète
  titre: Une < phrase > qui compte
  quote:
    quote: <p>La simplicité est la sophistication suprême.</p>
    author: Léonard de Vinci
image_only:
  image: 1600x900          # a placeholder image (or a media ID)
```

A variant without its own examples uses those of `base`, marked « (base) »; an element without any is listed
as « aucun exemple », with its fields.

## Standalone demo

`demo/` renders the library's sections without WordPress (`YmlDriver`), with sample data from
`demo/data.yml` (looked up by `<section>--<field>`, then by field name, then by type). From a clone:
`composer install`, then `composer start` (http://localhost:8001) or `lando start` at the repository root.
Installed as a plugin, the package has no `vendor/` of its own and the demo answers 404; `demo/` and `dev/` are
not part of the Composer archive.

## WordPress defaults

The plugin also: disables comments and pings; adds `title-tag`, `post-thumbnails` and `editor-styles` theme
support; adds a « Large paragraphe » style to TinyMCE; removes the emoji scripts; adds a Template column to the
pages list; redirects `/app/uploads` requests to `SFP_URL` when that variable is set; enables the Symfony
error handler when `WP_DEBUG_DISPLAY` is on and the package is available.

## Development

The development environment (Bedrock + Lando, test theme `carlo-test`, browser tests) is documented in
[dev/README.md](./dev/README.md). The repository is mounted live in it as `plugins/carlo`.

## Known issues

- `src/wp/templates/archive.php` and the `archive_content` AJAX action call templates that do not exist.
- `src/css/config/webfonts.css` points to `src/css/webfonts/` instead of `src/webfonts/`: Poppins is not loaded.
- `wp.php` still declares `Requires at least: 6.1` and `Requires PHP: 8.0`.
